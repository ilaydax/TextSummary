# *TextSummary*
</br>

Graph-Based Text Summary
</br>
In this project, this graphic model was visualized by transforming the sentences in a specific document into a graphic structure.
</br>
Then an algorithm was created that generates a summary with the nodes in the graph.
</br>
Each sentence in the graph represents a node. Sentences were scored by establishing a semantic relationship between the sentences.
